# WAML Pre-Conference Workshop: OpenIndexMaps

In this workshop, we'll learn how to use QGIS to create [OpenIndexMaps](https://openindexmaps.org/) GeoJSON files that can be used in GeoBlacklight and elsewhere to provide access to a series of maps, aerial photos, or other datasets.

## Workshop Instructors

[Stephen Appel](https://uwm.edu/libraries/people/appel-stephen/), University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee

[Tom Brittnacher](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/staff/tom-brittnacher), University of California Santa Barbara

## Workshop Details

UBC Vancouver Campus â€“ Koerner Library, Digital Scholarship Lab, Room 497. 

Bring your own laptop with QGIS installed, or use one of 10 computers in the lab (first-come, first serve).

## Schedule

We'll start with a bit of background information about:
- [Index Maps](index-maps) -- what are they?
- [OpenIndexMaps](openindexmaps) -- a community standard
- [GeoJSON](geojson) -- a spatial data format for the web
- [QGIS](qgis) -- free, open-source desktop GIS software

Then we'll work through various scenarios:
- [Exercise 1](exercise1): Create a polygon index map from an existing shapefile
- [Exercise 2](exercise2): Create a point index map from a spreadsheet containing coordinates
- [Exercise 3](exercise3): Create a grid index map from scratch

Finally, we will lead a disussion about future steps, community feedback, and questions.
