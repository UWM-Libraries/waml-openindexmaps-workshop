# WAML Pre-Conference Workshop: OpenIndexMaps

In this workshop, we'll learn how to use QGIS to create [OpenIndexMaps](https://openindexmaps.org/) GeoJSON files that can be used in GeoBlacklight and elsewhere to provide access to a series of maps, aerial photos, or other datasets.

## Workshop Instructors

[Stephen Appel](https://uwm.edu/libraries/people/appel-stephen/), University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee

[Tom Brittnacher](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/staff/tom-brittnacher), University of California Santa Barbara

## Workshop Details

UBC Vancouver Campus â€“ Koerner Library, Digital Scholarship Lab, Room 497. 

Bring your own laptop with QGIS installed, or use one of 10 computers in the lab (first-come, first serve).

The QGIS Version 3.28.5 LTR (Firenze) is what we used for planning and what is installed in the computer lab. 

Most versions of QGIS will work  fine for the limited functionality needed for the workshop.

### Download the data for this workshop:
- Link will be posted before the workshop, download and unzip. Data is found in the `data` directory.
- Alternatively, If you are familiar with Git and GitHub, you can clone the repository to your computer and access the data in the `data` directory.
## Schedule

We'll start with a bit of background information about:
- [Index Maps](index-maps) -- what are they?
- [OpenIndexMaps](openindexmaps) -- a community standard
- [GeoJSON](geojson) -- a spatial data format for the web
- [QGIS](qgis) -- free, open-source desktop GIS software

Then we'll work through various scenarios:
- [Exercise 1](exercise1) -- Create a polygon index map from an existing shapefile
- [Exercise 2](exercise2) -- Create a grid index map from scratch

Finally, we will lead a disussion about future steps, community feedback, and questions.

If you want to try an example using point data from a spreadsheet containing coordinates, you can do the optional exercise:
- [Optional Exercise](exercise-optional) -- Create a point index map from a spreadsheet containing coordinates

Note that we skipped Excercise 4 from the original workshop, [_Create a polygon index map using virtual layer magic_](https://kgjenkins.github.io/openindexmaps-workshop/exercise4). We also turned exercise 2 from the original workshop into the optional exercise.
