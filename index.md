# Creating GeoJSON for OpenIndexMaps
A workshop held at Geo4LibCamp, February 3, 2020, 1:30-4:30pm
by Keith Jenkins, GIS Librarian at Cornell University
<https://kgjenkins.github.io/openindexmaps-workshop/>

In this workshop, we'll learn how to use QGIS to create OpenIndexMaps GeoJSON files that can be used in GeoBlacklight (GBL) to provide access to a series of maps or other datasets.

Download the data for this workshop here:

We'll start with a bit of background information about:
- [Index Maps](index-maps) -- what are they?
- [OpenIndexMaps](openindexmaps) -- a community standard
- [GeoJSON](geojson) -- a spatial data format for the web
- [QGIS](qgis) -- free, open-source desktop GIS software

Then we'll work through various scenarios:
- [Exercise 1](exercise1): Create a polygon index map from an existing shapefile
- [Exercise 2](exercise2): Create a point index map from a spreadsheet containing coordinates
- [Exercise 3](exercise3): Create a grid index map from scratch
- [Exercise 4](exercise4): Create a polygon index map using virtual layer magic
